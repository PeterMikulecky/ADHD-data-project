# ADHD EEG Data Extraction, TDA Processing and File Management

This repository contains in-development MATLAB, Python and Bash scripts for use with
a project comparing traditional correlation-based functional connectivity
mapping of EEG data to topological data analysis (TDA) for the purposes of 
classification (here, ADHD versus control subjects) and identifying useful
features in the data. 

## Usage
- Files for use within MATLAB are identified with the .m extension.
- Files for use within Python are identified with the .py extension.
- Files for use within Bash are identified with the .sh extension.
