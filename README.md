# Project Focus: ADHD EEG Data Extraction, TDA Processing and File Management

This repository contains in-development MATLAB, Python and Bash scripts for use with
a project comparing traditional correlation-based functional connectivity
mapping of EEG data to topological data analysis (TDA) for the purposes of 
classification (here, ADHD versus control subjects) and identifying useful
features in the data. 

# Project Data:

This study uses an established, publicly avaliable dataset of both resting-state
and active (task-induced) EEG collected from 60 adolescent subjects diagnosed with
ADHD and 60 controls. You can find the original raw EEG data here:

# EEG Montage:

EEG data can be collected from single, site-specific scalp sensors or cap-mounted
arrays of varying sensor density. Sensor placements follow an international standard.
The sensor montage used in this study follows the "10-20" standard, as shown here:
