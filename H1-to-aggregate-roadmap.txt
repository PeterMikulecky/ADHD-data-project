Starting materials:
collection of csv files (H1 per subject):
	three columns (sensor ID, birth, death)


read in each H1 file:
	extract from filename the subject ID = subject_ID
	for each birth/death pair (per row), calculate death - birth = point_lifetime
	filter for point_lifetime > 35 (heuristic based on visual inspection)
	return filtered point set as: subject_ID, sensor ID, point_lifetime

	append across loops to generate master list for all subjects


summary stats:
	how many points per sensor
		by subject
		by group
		DECISION: aggregate or not multiple points per sensor
			aggregate: simple analysis
			disaggregate: decide how to cluster
			return final set of categories (just by sensor or multiple points per sensor)

	average and standard deviation of each category by group
	distributions by sensor and by group
	distribution of total by group

	heat map of average point-lifetime by sensor by group

hypothesis testing:
	for both total distribution and sensor-wise distributions:
		difference of two sample means (distribution control vs adhd)
		KL divergence distribution control vs adhd
